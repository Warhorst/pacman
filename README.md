# Pacman
A recreation of the arcade game "Pacman" with rust and the bevy engine.

Despite its age and appearance, Pacman was a quite complex game. Therefore, this project aims to battle test bevy.

(Use WASD or arrow keys to control pacman. Click into the canvas if it's not working)

## State of the game
The game is on version 1.0.0. As I implemented every feature listed in the pacman dossier (as far as I can tell), I consider the game feature complete.

There are still other things one can do, like:
- the main menu, with an introduction to all ghosts
- level transition cutscenes
- persisted high scores
- bugs from the original game, like Pinky cannot walk upwards or the "death screen"
- a new WASM build (would require an update of asset preload first)

The game was also designed (and therefore overengineered) with a map editor in mind (or at least custom maps). Maybe this will come to fruition one day.
